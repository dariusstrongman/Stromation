## 2025-01-30 - Workflow Replacement Studio Rebrand

### Overview
Transformed the site from a generic "AI automation agency" into a **Workflow Replacement Studio** with clear positioning, honest marketing, and a defined sales process centered on the $299 Automation Audit.

---

### Positioning Changes

**Before:** Generic AI automation services with placeholder pricing and fake testimonials
**After:** Custom workflow automation studio that replaces specific manual processes

- New tagline: "Replace Busywork With Systems"
- Core message: We build systems that replace manual steps in your workflow
- Primary CTA changed from "Free Consultation" to "$299 Automation Audit"
- Audit fee credited toward build if client proceeds

---

### Content Integrity Fixes

Removed all placeholder and unsubstantiated content:
- ❌ Phone number placeholders (123-456-7890)
- ❌ Generic [Name] and [Company] placeholders
- ❌ "X years of experience" claims
- ❌ Fake testimonials with made-up client names
- ❌ Unverifiable stats ("300+ automations deployed")

Replaced with:
- ✅ Real founder name (Darius Stroman)
- ✅ Real company name (Stromation)
- ✅ "Example Engagement" labels for anonymized case studies
- ✅ "Typical Outcomes" instead of guaranteed results

2. **Clear positioning** - "Workflow replacement" is specific and understandable vs generic "AI automation"
3. **Qualified leads** - Fit/not-fit sections and detailed intake form filter out bad-fit inquiries
4. **Real pricing signals** - Implementation ranges set expectations; $299 Audit ensures serious inquiries only
5. **Credibility through specificity** - Example engagements with actual workflow details are more believable than vague success claims
