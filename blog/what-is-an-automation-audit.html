            <h3>Key Takeaways</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>An automation audit is a structured analysis of your workflows, not a generic sales consultation</li>
                <li>You receive a workflow map, bottleneck analysis, prioritized opportunities, tool recommendations, and a build estimate</li>
                <li>The $99 fee is credited toward your project if you move forward</li>
                <li>The process takes about one week: discovery call, async deep-dive, then a deliverable you can act on</li>
                <li>It is designed for businesses already doing the work manually and ready to systematize</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <p>Most business owners know they should be automating something. The problem is figuring out <strong>what to automate first</strong>, which tools to use, and whether the investment will actually pay off. That is exactly what an automation audit answers.</p>

        <p>An automation audit is not a free discovery call where someone pitches you a retainer. It is not a vague strategy session. It is a paid, structured analysis of your actual workflows that produces a concrete deliverable: a map of where you are, where the bottlenecks are, and exactly what to build.</p>

        <h2>What You Actually Get</h2>

        <p>When you pay $99 for a Stromation automation audit, you receive five things:</p>

        <h3>1. A Complete Workflow Map</h3>

        <p>We document your current process from start to finish. Every step, every handoff, every tool involved. This is not a guess based on a 30-minute conversation. We dig into the details: who does what, how long each step takes, and where information moves between systems.</p>

        <p>For example, if you run a service business, we might map: lead comes in via website form, gets added to a spreadsheet, someone emails them within a few hours, they respond, someone manually creates a proposal in Google Docs, sends it, follows up three times, then manually creates a project in your PM tool. That is seven manual steps, and most of them do not need a human.</p>

        <h3>2. Bottleneck Analysis</h3>

        <p>Once we see the full picture, we identify where time and money are leaking. Common bottlenecks we find include:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Leads waiting 4-6 hours for a first response (industry data shows response rates drop 80% after 5 minutes)</li>
            <li>Data being manually copied between tools (CRM to spreadsheet to email to project management)</li>
            <li>Follow-ups that depend on someone remembering to send them</li>
            <li>Reports that take 2-3 hours to compile from multiple sources</li>
            <li>Onboarding steps that get skipped because there is no enforced sequence</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>3. Prioritized Automation Opportunities</h3>

        <p>Not everything should be automated at once. We rank each opportunity by two factors: <strong>impact</strong> (how much time or revenue it affects) and <strong>complexity</strong> (how difficult it is to build). This gives you a clear roadmap. The quick wins go first. The complex, lower-impact items can wait.</p>

        <h3>4. Tool Recommendations</h3>

        <p>We are tool-agnostic. Depending on your needs, we might recommend Zapier for a simple integration, Make for a more complex visual workflow, n8n for something that needs full control and self-hosting, or a direct API integration for high-volume operations. You get an honest recommendation, not a pitch for whatever platform pays us a referral fee.</p>

        <h3>5. Build Estimate</h3>

        <p>You get a specific cost and timeline estimate for each automation opportunity. Not a range so wide it is meaningless. Actual numbers based on the complexity we identified. A simple lead capture automation might be $1,000-$1,500 and take a week. A full end-to-end client lifecycle system might be $8,000-$12,000 and take 4-6 weeks.</p>

        </div>

        <h2>The Process: How It Works</h2>

        <p>The entire audit takes about one week from start to finish. Here is what happens:</p>

        <h3>Step 1: Discovery Call (45-60 minutes)</h3>

        <p>We get on a call and walk through your current operations. This is not a pitch meeting. We ask specific questions: What does your day look like? Where do you spend time on repetitive tasks? What tools are you using? What breaks most often? What would change if you had an extra 10 hours a week?</p>

        <h3>Step 2: Async Deep-Dive (3-5 business days)</h3>

        <p>After the call, we go to work. We analyze your tools, research integration options, map out the workflows, identify the bottlenecks, and build your recommendations. This is the part you are paying for. It is not a template. It is custom analysis based on your specific business.</p>

        <h3>Step 3: Deliverable + Walkthrough</h3>

        <p>You receive a written audit document with everything described above: workflow map, bottleneck analysis, prioritized opportunities, tool recommendations, and build estimates. We then do a 30-minute walkthrough call to review the findings and answer your questions.</p>

        <h2>Why $99?</h2>

        <p>Three reasons.</p>

        <p>First, <strong>it ensures we are both serious</strong>. Free consultations attract tire-kickers. A $99 commitment means you actually have a problem you want solved, and we can invest real time in the analysis.</p>

        <p>Second, <strong>it funds the actual work</strong>. A proper audit takes 4-6 hours of focused analysis. That is real research, not a sales deck with your logo pasted on it.</p>

        <p>Third, <strong>the $99 is credited toward your build</strong>. If you decide to move forward with any of the recommended automations, the audit fee comes off your project cost. So it is either a $99 investment in clarity (which is valuable on its own) or it is free.</p>

        <h2>Who Is This For?</h2>

        <p>The automation audit works best for:</p>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Small business owners</strong> who are personally doing admin work that takes 5-15 hours per week and know it should be automated but do not know where to start</li>
            <li><strong>Agency and consulting firms</strong> that need to streamline client onboarding, reporting, or internal operations to scale without adding headcount</li>
            <li><strong>Solo operators</strong> who are the bottleneck in their own business and need systems so they can focus on revenue-generating work</li>
            <li><strong>Teams already using Zapier or Make</strong> that have outgrown basic automations and need something more robust</li>
        </ul>

        <p>It is not for businesses that are just curious about AI, need a full software product built, or do not yet have repeatable processes to automate.</p>

        <h2>What Happens After the Audit?</h2>

        <p>You have three options:</p>

        <ol>
            <li><strong>Take the deliverable and run with it.</strong> Some businesses use the audit to build internally or hand to their own developer. The audit is yours to keep regardless.</li>
            <li><strong>Hire us to build it.</strong> We scope a project based on the audit findings, credit your $99, and get started. Most builds take 1-6 weeks depending on complexity.</li>
            <li><strong>Do nothing yet.</strong> Maybe the timing is not right. The audit is still valid in 3-6 months when you are ready. Your workflows do not change that fast.</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Common Questions</h2>

        <h3>Do I need to prepare anything?</h3>

        <p>Just be ready to walk us through your current process. If you have access to the tools you use (CRM, email platform, project management), that helps but is not required for the initial call.</p>

        <h3>Is this just a sales pitch in disguise?</h3>

        <p>No. The deliverable has value whether or not you hire us. We have had clients take the audit to other developers. That is fine. We would rather build something real than pressure someone into a project they are not ready for.</p>

        <h3>What if my workflows are too simple to need an audit?</h3>

        <p>If your automation needs are straightforward (connect two tools, send an email when X happens), you probably do not need a full audit. Reach out via our <a href="../contact.html">contact page</a> and we can tell you in five minutes whether an audit makes sense or whether you just need a quick build.</p>

        <h3>How is this different from a free consultation?</h3>

        <p>Free consultations are sales meetings. You get 30 minutes of general advice and a proposal. An automation audit is 4-6 hours of analysis that produces a document you can act on. The depth is completely different.</p>
